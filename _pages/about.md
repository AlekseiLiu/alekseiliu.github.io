I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at Bielefeld University, with a focus on anomaly/outlier detection and out-of-distribution data. My work progresses from interpretable AutoML pipelines, to dynamic graph neural networks for outlier detection, and finally to probabilistic frameworks that capture uncertainty under noise and adversarial settings.
